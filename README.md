# Resampling and Simulation Project  
### This is a Group Project done in a team capacity of 4.  
In this project we took a turn to explore the 
* 1.General procedures of simulating samples from Normal, Chi-square, F and other continuous distributions;   
* 2.Observing the behavior of sample characteristics in repetitive sampling;   
* 3.Understanding resampling methods: jackknife and Bootstrap and   
* 4.Monte Carlo method.   
Practice of Simulation and its techniques facilitate testing of models; saves money, time and man power. It is flexible to use and reliable when real data in hand are absent.
